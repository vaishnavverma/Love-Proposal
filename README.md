💖 Love Proposal Web Page

A cute interactive web page for proposing! The “No” button tries to escape your click, while the “Yes” button stays fixed — making it a fun and playful way to ask someone out.

🎨 Features

Yes button – stays fixed and fully clickable. Perfect for saying “Yes!”

No button – teleports a small distance only when clicked, making it hard to refuse.

Smooth transitions so the “No” button moves naturally.

Fully responsive and works on all modern browsers.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML – structure of the proposal page

CSS – styling, colors, fonts, and layout

JavaScript – interactivity and button movement

git clone https://github.com/vaishnavverma/Love-Proposal.git

Click the No button and watch it move away 😆.
